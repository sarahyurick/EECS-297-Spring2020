For project 2, the bulk of the code is found in the result.cgi script. 
The user can input a product they are looking for,
and the page will return that product's availability in Sam's Club, Walmart, and Dollar General. 
On my server, I had some trouble getting the data from Sam's Club,
which tended to return outdated data for whatever reason,
but in general it still returns listed products which are in stock
(it's just that the page source itself isn't always updated), so I kept it. 

The resultwork.cgi script also attempts to get Best Buy products, which it is able to do, 
but only after you refresh the page after searching, and it also tends not to return all of the products and only some. 
So it is a bit glitchy, but I thought worth including anyway. 

See p2_demo0.mp4 for a demo of functionality: 
the first part of the video depicts using the result.cgi script, 
and at the end there is a brief demo of the resultwork.cgi script.
